# flip button challenge

Welcome to the Mediatool component exercise. If you read this, you should have
received the specification of the component to make in a separate document.
Implement it in this repository and make a PR for it.

You may install any other dependency that you like to acheive the goal. And you
can use any technique to your liking such as plain css, css in js, UI
frameworks and so on.

Good luck!

## instructions

Clone this repository, run `npm install` and then `npm run dev` to launch the
local server. Create your component in a suitable file and display it in
different ways it can be used on the main page.
